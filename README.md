# msnk
An R package implementing various Kurtosis indices for Multivariate Skewed Normal distribution.

## What has been implemented so far

* `%s%` :
 MacRae "star" product (1974) has been implemented so far since it is used to calculate some of the multidimensional indicies. It hass been implemented as a binary operator to include it more easily in equations and make them more readable.
* `mardia` : the unidimensional mardia index has been implemented in his specific form for the Multivariate Skewed Normal distribution.
